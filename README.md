K40 Whisperer
=============

Originally by [Scorch](http://scorchworks.com). This is a fork that aims to
clean up the codebase, improve reliabality and introduce features useful for
multi-user (ie. Hackerspace) use, like:

 - network support / modularization
 - accounting
 - lockdown

Work in progress.
